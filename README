Checkpoint One
 
1. Compiling:
make
 
2. Running:

* Only run parser and save syntax tree to <filename>.abs:
  java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM -a tests/<filename>.cm

* Run parser and semantic analyzer:
  * Print to syntax tree and symbol table to terminal:
    java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM tests/<filename>.cm
  * Save syntax tree to <filename>.abs and symbol table to <filename>.sym:
    java -cp /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. -s CM tests/<filename>.cm

  * Note: Semantic analyzer will not run if there are parse errors


Assumptions:
* All global variables and function declarations are declared right before leaving global scope
* -s flag means tree should be still saved to .abs in addition to symbol table saved to .sym
* no flag means that both tree and symbol table should be printed
* "int input(void)" and "void output(int)" are predefined functions that do not show in symbol table
